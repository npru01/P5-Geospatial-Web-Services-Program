== Introduction
_(Mandatory. The introduction is located on a separated page  preceding the ‘Scope’ statement. The introduction is not numbered.)_

A Web Processing Service (WPS) executes processes based on geospatial data.

This version 2.0 defines (_from OGC 14-065_)

* a Core conceptual model that may be sed to specify a WPS in different architectures such as REST or SOAP,
* a process model to support the description and discovery of processes on the web,
* a basic data model that supports arbitrary (standard or non-standard) data formats for inputs and outputs,
* a WPS service model and encoding based on OGC baseline standards, and
* a Dismiss extension to allow clients to terminate asynchronous processing jobs.


The WPS service model defines five operations, the Dismiss operation (allowing a user to cancel a job) being defined as an extension to it:

* _GetCapabilities_ (mandatory): returns service metadata,
* _DescribeProcess_ (mandatory): returns the description of a specific process,
* _Execute_ (mandatory): creates a job to run a specific process,
* _GetStatus_: returns status information about a processing job,
* _GetResult_: returns the result of a processing job,

Two bindings are now defined for these operations : HTTP/POST+XML and HTTP/GET+KVP (excepted for the _Execute_ operation)

Conformity to the standard is organized with five conformance classes:

* Basic WPS service profile
* Synchronous WPS
* Asynchronous WPS
* WPS process model encoding
* Dismiss extension

The "_basic WPS service profile_"  defines a minimal WPS implementation that comprises the synchronous and asynchronous execution protocol, the WPS process model, and implements HTTP/POST+XML and HTTP/GET+KVP encodings.
